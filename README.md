## Description
This git repo contains all source code for five separate coding projets implemented within a Java environment. The five included projects are: 
1. Polynomial Evaluation 
2. Expression Evaluation 
3. DOM-Tree 
4. Little Search Engine 
5. Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) 

All projects contain some combination of the following data structures: 
- Linked Lists 
- Binary Trees
- Hash Maps 
- Encapsulated Objects 
- Try/Catch 
- File I/O 

*This list is not fully comprehensive, and more structures exist within the implementation* 

Each project file consists of its own README.md detailing the assignment description within the assignment folder. The *src* filepath within each project contains the 
implementation code created by the author for solution of the problem. All solution code was implemented within the Eclipse IDE.
